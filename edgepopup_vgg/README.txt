This is a designated implementation of edgepopup with support for loading a ticket hidden in VGG16, given as simple pickel file containing model parameters.
Due to github size restrictions, we can not provide this file in the repository, feel free to contact us if you would like to obtain our Synflow ticket from the original publication.

Executing runExp.sh will run the whole experiment from the paper, automatically loading and hiding the ticket in VGG16, given that the ticket is placed in this folder and named 'modelBest.pt'.

Relevant functions to hide your own ticket can be found in planting.py and initializers.py.
